             Dear Lily, Happy Birthday! You're legally on paper 1 number older than I am. How does it feel to be dating a minor. The first time we really started interacted was around this time too, when you turned 20. I honestly 
             tried looking for when we met exactly. Took a lot of scrolling to find our first games, but I couldn't find it. What I do know is it was a bit before your birthday. We were playing split and you were viper, you 
             were lagging so much we had to FF. So maybe that's why I couldn't find it. A couple days later it was your birthday. I still remember you always leaving vc to go to bed, but we didn't hear you say goodnight and 
             we would always ping you in gen chat. I became so close to you in such a short amount of time, it was as if we knew each other for so much longer. I'm proud of you for coming this far and continuing to push forward.
             I know times can be tough, but no matter what you have been able to persevere and make it through. You're the woman I fell in love with and continue to love. 
            </p1>
